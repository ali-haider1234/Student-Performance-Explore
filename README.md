# 🎓 Student Performance Explorer

An interactive **R Shiny application** for analyzing and visualizing student performance in **Mathematics, Reading, and Writing**. This project provides statistical insights, regression models, and visualizations to uncover patterns in academic performance.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore student performance data and provide an interactive dashboard for:

* Identifying trends in Math, Reading, and Writing scores
* Visualizing distributions and probabilities
* Building regression models to examine relationships between subjects
* Generating summary statistics and confidence intervals

This project demonstrates the integration of **R, Shiny, ggplot2, and statistical modeling** for educational data analysis.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The application uses a dataset: **`Modified_StudentsPerformance.csv`**

**Fields included:**

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

---

## ✨ Features

✔️ Histograms to visualize score distributions
✔️ Probability distributions with normal overlays
✔️ Regression models between subject scores
✔️ Confidence intervals for regression models
✔️ Summary statistics: Mean, Median, SD, IQR
✔️ Interactive UI built with **Shiny + shinydashboard**
